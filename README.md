-> Identifies high-performing states and cities
-> Analyzes sales trends for marketing insights

# Key Analysis Performed
-> Month-by-month total sales analysis
-> High-value product marketing location analysis
-> Average Order Value calculation by payment mode
-> GroupBy aggregations for business insights
-> Data validation and filtering

# Tools Used
